        <h2> Hey! I'm Gloria Vazquez </h2>
      
        <p>
          I'm a software developer from New York City, currently living in Santa            Teresa, New Mexico.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Aside from my love of coding and programming, my hobbies include:  
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li> Spending as much time as I can with my family. </li>
          <li> Listening and dancing to music. </li>
          <li> Designing and making custom clothing. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> About Me</h2>
      
      <p>  I've worn many hats throughout the years. In addition to the many jobs I've held, I also been self-employed for about 12 years now working as a child care provider, accountant, tax preparer, and designing custom clothing. </p>
      
      <p>  After years of hesitation, I decided to explore a career as a software developer and realized I had a passion for it. I'm so excited to expand on my skills while meeting and working with other developers. </p>

      <p>
        If you're looking to hire (or share some amazing knowledge and experiences) please don't hesitate to reach out. I love making new friends and taking chances on new opportunities.
